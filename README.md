## Progress

- Started a new Nuxt 3 project.

- Spend most of the first day lookin at what I want to do and use for this assignment.

- Made a header and footer that will live on the `app.vue` so that I can maintain a consistent layout.

- I added extra folders into my pages folder so that I could test out how the layout from the `app.vue` page is carrying over and making sure I did it right.

- Page more rendering and getting and issue.

- FIXED! Instead of using `<NuxtPage />`, I used `<NuxtPages />`. Fortunately it did not take very long to figure out.

--- Another day

- Going to add tailwind. Tried to ued vanilla css but its taking me to long to scroll up and down to see what I need to do and what I am affecting.

- Successfully added tailwind.
