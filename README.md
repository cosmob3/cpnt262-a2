## Progress

- Started a new Nuxt 3 project.

- Spend most of the first day lookin at what I want to do and use for this assignment.

- Made a header and footer that will live on the `app.vue` so that I can maintain a consistent layout.

- I added extra folders into my pages folder so that I could test out how the layout from the `app.vue` page is carrying over and making sure I did it right.

- Page more rendering and getting and issue.

- FIXED! Instead of using `<NuxtPage />`, I used `<NuxtPages />`. Fortunately it did not take very long to figure out.

--- Another day

- Going to add tailwind. Tried to ued vanilla css but its taking me to long to scroll up and down to see what I need to do and what I am affecting.

- Successfully added tailwind.

- Started working on navigation bar so that you are able to jump between pages. There will only be some sample text on other pages but I wanted to make sure the navigation bar worked.

- Finished Navbar. Now to work on Hero section.

- The Hero Section wasn't too hard to do but I will need to make a reusable cta to add to The Hero.

- Needed to rotate my images a bit to give it some extra styles but when I used tailwind to do so it only allow up to 180 degrees counter clockwise but I needed the image 45 degrees clockwise.

- So I just found out if you add a `-` before`rotate-12` as so `-rotate-12` then it will go clockwise!!!

- Time to work on short bio section.

- Bio section was super easy.

- Now to make some cards. I think I'll revisit my achievement 7 and use that for my cards.

- Using those cards was really usedful. Definitely sped things up.

- Just had to remove what I didn't need and to style them a bit.

- Landing page is finished!

- Now to quickly make it responsive.

- DONE! OMG I thought that was going to be the easy part... :'(

- I can now see the benefit starting a project with the mobile first mindset.
